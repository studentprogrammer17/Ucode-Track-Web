   <h2 id = "AnchorWMAS">What makes a superhero?</h2>
    <p>A superhero is a person who does heroic deeds and has the ability to do them in a way that a normal person couldn’t. 
    So in order to be a<br> superhero, <b>you need a power that is more exceptional than any power a normal human being could possess</b>, 
    and you need to use<br> that power to accomplish good deeds. Otherwise, a policeman or a fireman could be considered a superhero.<br> 
    For instance, a good guy fighting a bad guy could be just a regular police story or detective story or human-interest story.
    But if it’s a <br> good guy with a superpower who is fighting a bad guy, it becomes a superhero story. 
    If the good guy is doing something that a normal <br> human being couldn’t do, couldn’t accomplish, then I assume he becomes a superhero.</p>

    <h2>My favourite superhero</h2>
    <img src="../t00_welcome_heroes/assets/images/t00.png" alt="flash" width="200">
    <p>Flash</p>
    <p>The Flash is one of DC Comics' most popular characters and has been integral to the publisher's many reality-changing "crisis" storylines over the years. <br> 
        The original meeting of the Golden Age Flash Jay Garrick and Silver Age Flash Barry Allen in "Flash of Two Worlds" (1961) introduced the Multiverse <br> storytelling concept to DC readers,  which would become the basis for many DC stories in the years to come.
        Like his Justice League colleagues Wonder Woman, <br> Superman and Batman, the Flash has a distinctive cast of adversaries, including the various Rogues (unique among DC supervillains for their code of honor) and <br>
         the various psychopathic "speedsters" who go by the names Reverse-Flash or Zoom. Other supporting characters in Flash stories include Barry's wife Iris West, <br>
          Wally's wife Linda Park,  Bart's girlfriend Valerie Perez, friendly fellow speedster Max Mercury, and Central City police department members David Singh and Patty Spivot.</p>
