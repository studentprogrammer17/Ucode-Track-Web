                The &lt;h1&gt; HTML tag is usually used for the title of a page or post and it is the first header visible on a page. The formatting of an h1 usually differs from the rest of the header tags found on a page (h2, h3, h4).

            <div class = "col">
              Code Example: <br> &lt;h1&gt;Main title&lt;/h1&gt;

                The &lt;p&gt; tag defines a paragraph. Browsers automatically add a single blank line before and after each &lt;p&gt; element.

                The &lt;div&gt; tag is known as Division tag. The div tag is used in HTML to make divisions of content in the web page like (text, images, header, footer, navigation bar, etc)

                The &lt;img&gt; tag is used to embed an image in an HTML page.
                Images are not technically inserted into a web page; images are linked to web pages. The &lt;img&gt; tag creates a holding space for the referenced image.

              <div class = "colProtocl">
                The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application layer protocol in the Internet protocol suite model for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems.[2] HTTP is the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web, where hypertext documents include hyperlinks to other resources that the user can easily access, for example by a mouse click or by tapping the screen in a web browser.
              </div>
              <div class = "colProtocl">
                Development of HTTP was initiated by Tim Berners-Lee at CERN in 1989 and summarized in a simple document describing the behavior of a client and a server using the first HTTP protocol version that was named 0.9.
              </div>
              <div class = "colProtocl">
                That first version of HTTP protocol soon evolved into a more elaborated version that was the first draft toward a far future version 1.0

              <div class = "colProtocl">
                The GET method requests that the target resource transfers a representation of its state. GET requests should only retrieve data and should have no other effect. (This is also true of some other HTTP methods.)
              </div>
              <div class = "colProtocl">
                The POST method requests that the target resource processes the representation enclosed in the request according to the semantics of the target resource. For example, it is used for posting a message to an Internet forum, subscribing to a mailing list, or completing an online shopping transaction.
              </div>
              <div class = "colProtocl">
                The PUT method requests that the target resource creates or updates its state with the state defined by the representation enclosed in the request. A distinction to POST is that the client specifies the target location on the server

              <div class = "colProtocl">
                The Domain Name System (DNS) is the hierarchical and decentralized naming system used to identify computers, services, and other resources reachable through the Internet or other Internet Protocol (IP) networks.

              <div class = "colProtocl">
                DNS transport protocols: DNS-over-UDP/53 ("Do53")
                From the time of its origin in 1983 until quite recently, DNS has primarily answered queries on User Datagram Protocol (UDP) port number 53.

              <div class = "colProtocl">
                DNS transport protocols: The DNSCrypt protocol, which was developed in 2011 outside the IETF standards framework, introduced DNS encryption on the downstream side of recursive resolvers, wherein clients encrypt query payloads using servers' public keys, which are published in the DNS

              <div class = "colProtocl">
                The Internet Protocol (IP) is the network layer communications protocol in the Internet protocol suite for relaying datagrams across network boundaries. Its routing function enables internetworking, and essentially establishes the Internet.
              </div>
              <div class = "colProtocl">
                The Internet Protocol is responsible for addressing host interfaces, encapsulating data into datagrams (including fragmentation and reassembly) and routing datagrams from a source host interface to a destination host interface across one or more IP networks.[3] For these purposes, the Internet Protocol defines the format of packets and provides an addressing system.
              </div>
              <div class = "colProtocl">
                IP addressing entails the assignment of IP addresses and associated parameters to host interfaces. The address space is divided into subnetworks, involving the designation of network prefixes.
